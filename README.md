# New glass

This mod provides a glowing version of steel framed obsidian glass node from a ``framedglass`` mod.
Possibly it'll add more types of glass later. Maybe not.

TODO

More colors
-----------

* Check if [framedglass](https://github.com/minetest-mods/framedglass/blob/master/init.lua) supports dyes on PandoraBox.
* Learn how [stained glass](https://github.com/minetest-mods/stained_glass/blob/d1b0278c68351e1f0a19ef692ff95e98e3d23947/init.lua) is structured for the definition of differently colored blocks
* Try and make something similar to the different colors of ``dark_glass`` from ``scifi_nodes``
